				<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Communication Access Real-Time Translation (CART) is a professional service designed to provide real-time translation of spoken language into text.  
<br>
<br>Here's how it typically works: as a trained stenographer, using a shorthand machine and specialised software, listens to the spoken dialogue and sounds in real-time, they rapidly transcribe what is being said to create captions.  Other captioning providers use software and then “re-speak” the words of the presenter.  In each case, the captions are then projected on a screen for an individual or audience to read.  This instantaneous translation allows readers to follow along with the conversation or presentation at the same time as everyone else, providing them with access to auditory information.
<br>
<br>CART can be delivered onsite, where the CART provider is physically present at the event, or remotely, where the provider listens to the audio feed and transcribes from a remote location.  This flexibility makes CART a versatile and effective tool for ensuring communication access in various settings.  CART is also sometimes called open captioning, real-time stenography, or real-time captioning.
<br>
<br>The technology captioning platforms and captioner skillset can vary between providers.  Here are some CART suppliers:
<br>
<br>-  121 Captions
<br>-  Access Captions
<br>-  Access Media
<br>-  Ai-Media
<br>-  Bradley Reporting
<br>-  Caption It
<br>-  The Captioning Studio
<br>-  Deaf Connect
<br>-  Reporters Ink
<br>-  Rojaley Reporting
<br>-  The SubStation
<br>-  Word for Word Australia
<br>-  ZOO Digital</p>

				<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">There may be times where mobile applications (apps) may be more suited to your needs to access audio and video content in various situations. These are often cheaper, more widely available and a great option to increase accessibility.
<br><br>There are speech-to-text apps available that can provide real-time captioning for various audio and video content. Some video streaming and business communication platforms have built-in captions as a functionality for content creators and/or users. Here are a few popular captioning apps:<br><br><strong>Live Transcribe</strong>: Developed by Google, this app provides real-time transcription of speech to text.&nbsp; It captures spoken words and displays them as captions in near real-time. Users can also customise the text size and color for better readability.<br><br><strong>
Live Caption:&nbsp;</strong>Live Caption is a built-in accessibility feature on Android devices that automatically generates real-time captions for any media with spoken content, such as videos, podcasts, and audio messages.&nbsp; It enables users to read along with spoken content in various apps without requiring an internet connection.<br>
<br><strong>NALscribe:&nbsp;</strong>NALscribe is an AI-powered captioning tool designed to provide accurate and real-time captions for live events, conferences, and meetings.&nbsp; It offers features such as speaker identification, customisable display options, and support for multiple languages.&nbsp; NALscribe aims to improve accessibility for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing by making live events more inclusive.<br>
<br><strong>RogerVoice:&nbsp;</strong>RogerVoice is a communication app that provides real-time captions for phone calls, allowing individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to participate in conversations more effectively.&nbsp; It utilises speech recognition technology to transcribe spoken words into text in real-time, enabling users to read what the other person is saying during phone calls.&nbsp; RogerVoice also supports multiple languages and offers features like adjustable text size and color for better readability.<br>
<br><strong>Ava</strong>: Ava is a speech-to-text app that offers live captioning for conversations in real-time.&nbsp; It utilises artificial intelligence to transcribe speech from multiple speakers, making it ideal for group discussions, meetings, or social gatherings.
<br>
<br><strong>Otter.ai</strong>: Otter.ai is an AI-powered transcription app that generates accurate transcripts of audio recordings, including meetings, interviews, and lectures.&nbsp; It features real-time transcription, searchable archives, and the ability to differentiate between speakers.
<br>
<br><strong>Subtitle Viewer</strong>: Subtitle Viewer is an app that provides captioning for videos on mobile devices.&nbsp; It allows users to import videos from various sources and overlay captions in real-time, making it easier for individuals who are hard of hearing to follow along with the content.<br>
<br>Captioning apps vary in features and functionalities, including being restricted to a country.&nbsp; There are also limitations with automatic speech recognition technologies to consistently deliver the quality of captioning necessary for comprehension, especially in business.&nbsp; Lack of or inaccurate captions can be harmful to your brand, driving away and preventing people from understanding your message.<br></p>

				<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">All Australians are entitled to have reasonable access, on an equitable basis, to affordable standard telephone services and payphones, whether they reside or carry on business.&nbsp; The performance standards of such telephone services and payphones must reasonably meet the social, industrial and commercial needs of the Australian community.&nbsp; People who are deaf, deafblind, or have a hearing and/or speech impediment must be enabled to make and receive telephone calls on terms, and in circumstances, that are comparable to those on which other Australians have access to a standard telephone service.&nbsp; The Australian Government delivers this responsibility through the National Relay Service.<br><br>Captioned telephones are a telecommunication device with features the same or similar to that used by Australians – and provide captions of the conversation in real-time.&nbsp; These phones work by displaying written captions of what the other party is saying during a phone call, allowing the user to read along while listening, which can greatly enhance comprehension and communication.&nbsp; Here are a few types of captioned telephones available:
<br>
<br><strong>CapTel Phones</strong>: CapTel (Captioned Telephone) phones are one of the most common types of captioned telephones. These phones feature a built-in screen that displays captions of the caller's words in real-time. Users can listen to the caller's voice and read the captions simultaneously, ensuring full access to the conversation.<br><br>
<strong>Konnekt Phones:&nbsp;</strong>Konnekt Phones are specialised telephones designed for individuals with hearing loss.&nbsp; These phones feature a built-in screen that displays real-time captions of the conversation as it unfolds.&nbsp; Users can read the captions while simultaneously listening to the caller's voice, making it easier to follow along and participate in phone conversations.&nbsp; Konnekt Phones aim to improve accessibility and communication for individuals with hearing impairments, allowing them to stay connected with friends, family, and colleagues.<br><br><strong>TTY Handsets:&nbsp;</strong>TTY (Teletypewriter) Handsets, also known as TTY/TDD (Telecommunications Device for the Deaf), are communication devices specifically designed for individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, or speech-impaired.&nbsp; These devices allow users to communicate over the telephone by typing messages that are then transmitted as text.&nbsp; TTY Handsets typically consist of a keyboard for typing messages and a display screen for reading incoming messages.&nbsp; They enable individuals with hearing or speech impairments to make and receive phone calls independently, bridging the communication gap between them and the caller.<strong><br></strong><br><strong>Ultratec Superprint</strong>: Ultratec Superprint phones are another option for individuals who are hard of hearing. These phones display captions of the conversation on a large built-in screen, making it easy for users to read along while talking on the phone.
<br>
<br><strong>CaptionCall Phones</strong>: CaptionCall phones combine amplified sound with captioning features to provide clear and accessible phone calls for individuals with hearing loss. These phones include features like adjustable volume, tone control, and customisable captions to meet the user's needs.
<br>
<br>Overall, captioned telephones play a crucial role in facilitating communication for individuals who are hard of hearing or deaf, allowing them to stay connected with friends, family, and businesses through phone calls with confidence and ease.<br></p>
