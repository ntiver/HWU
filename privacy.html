<br>We collect your Personal Information for the primary purpose of providing our services to you, providing information to our members and marketing. We may also use your Personal Information for secondary purposes closely related to the primary purpose, in circumstances where you would reasonably expect such use or disclosure. You may unsubscribe from our mailing/marketing lists at any time by contacting us in writing.
<br>
<br>When we collect Personal Information we will, where appropriate and where possible, explain to you why we are collecting the information and how we plan to use it .

<br>Sensitive information is defined in the Privacy Act to include information or opinion about such things as an individual's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union or other professional body, criminal record or health information.
<br>
<br>Sensitive information will be used by us only:
<br>
<br>• For the primary purpose for which it was obtained

<br>• For a secondary purpose that is directly related to the primary purpose
<br>
<br>• With your consent; or where required or authorised by law.
<br>
<br><strong>Third Parties

<br>Where reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect your Personal Information only from you. However, in some circumstances we may be provided with information by third parties. In such a case we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of the information provided to us by the third party.
<br>

<br>Your Personal Information may be disclosed in a number of circumstances including the following:

<br>
<br><strong>Security of Personal Information
<br></strong>
<br>Your Personal Information is stored in a manner that reasonably protects it from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
<br>
<br>When your Personal Information is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was obtained, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify your Personal Information. However, most of the Personal Information is or will be stored in client files which will be kept by us for a minimum of 7 years.
